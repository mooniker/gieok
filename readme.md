# Overview

_Project Gieok_ ("ghee uhk") is a [memory/concentration card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)) implemented in CSS and JavaScript/jQuery with semantic HTML as a two-day [assignment](https://github.com/ga-dc/project1) for full-time students at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/washington-dc)'s [Web Development Immersive program](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive) in Washington, D.C. All graphics and animations are handled in CSS and HTML. JavaScript administers the game's business logic, updates stats to the HTML, and toggles elements' classes on click events.

See the [demo hosted on Github](http://mooniker.github.io/gieok/).

## CSS

The CSS for the playing cards is lightly adapted from Jeff Yaus's [CSS Playing Cards](https://github.com/jyaus/css-playing-cards/) (v.2.0, released Feb. 2015). No images were used in this project, which is why the face cards appropriate chess-related symbols via HTML character codes. The flipping animation is also adapted from David DeSandro's [Intro to CSS 3D transforms](https://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/docs/card-flip.html).

## User Stories

- As a user, I should be able to click on a pair of cards to turn them over to see their content.
- As a user, I should be able get visual feedback when I click on a matching pair to confirm that I've matched them correctly or incorrectly.
- As a user, I should be able to supply my own content for some of the cards so I can customize the game.
- As a user, I should be able to toggle or adjust visual and content aspects of the game so that I have some choice in how the game works.
- As a user I should be able to resize my screen without interfering with gameplay so that the game works on various-sized devices.
