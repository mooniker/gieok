# Overview

_Project Gieok_ ("ghee uhk") is a [memory/concentration card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game) implemented in CSS and JavaScript/jQuery with semantic HTML as a two-day [assignment](https://github.com/ga-dc/project1) for full-time students at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/washington-dc)'s [Web Development Immersive program](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive) in Washington, D.C. All graphics and animations are handled in CSS with HTML entities and JavaScript toggling classes on click events and updating stats.

See the [demo hosted on Github](http://mooniker.github.io/gieok/).

## CSS

The CSS for the playing cards is lightly adapted from Jeff Yaus's [CSS Playing Cards](https://github.com/jyaus/css-playing-cards/) (v.2.0, released Feb. 2015). The flipping animation is also CSS adapted from David DeSandro's [Intro to CSS 3D transforms](https://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/docs/card-flip.html).
