## Project Workflow
meets/exceeds expectations. Really enjoyed reading your readme, it was very thorough. Love the credits you give to other developers as well as future goals and good user stories

## Technical Requirements
Exceeds expectations. Really great job tackling this problem. Theres a minor but with the setTimeout and flipping the cards back over. What I really liked about this project was the Object Oriented design you took in developing this solution. I think with this baseline code, it's more modular and scalable. Other solutions I've seen are more rigid in that sense and aren't as flexible for further implementation. Your solution allows you to plug and play attributes if extended functionality is necessary. Once we get into OOJS, you can see how we have objects and corresponding views that allow us to encapsulate properties and behaviors.

## Code Quality
Exceeds Expectations. Code is well commented and indented. Very clear comments about what blocks of code are going to do. Makes it really easy for another developer to assess/refactor and help the code along. Also future you will be pleased should you continue to work on this application. One minor note, in production we want to limit logging and extraneous commented out code.

## Problem Solving
Exceeds Expectations. Although the problem is a simple one, attempting and object oriented solution is not. We can all write jQuery soup. It's extremely difficult to map out the right domain for these things. The design you chose is great; however, if we want to truly take an object oriented approach(which for this domain maybe(is?) completely unnesccessary), we want to start thinking of each individual card as its own model with properties and behaviors much like your game object. Really the game object is almost like a namespace for the global object, we just call it game instead of window. Anyways, if you want to talk more about this later, let me know. I'm always happy to talk about OOP.

## Overall
Really fantastic job james. Really happy with your progress in the course.
